# Lyric Finder

For quite awhile now I've been enjoying using Raycast, I've always known that you can create extensions for Raycast easily, through the use of React and Typescript.
So, after finishing my last project I decided to make this Lyric Search extension.

Ever had an earworm for a song that you just can't remember?

But you're like me, and too lazy to leave the comfort of the Raycast launcher?

Well, this extension is perfect for you! It Utilizes the Genius Lyric Finder to give a list of songs generated from the lyrics you remember.
